# Wordle-Helper

Wordle-Helper can be used alongside Wordle to exclude words that aren't correct solutions based on previous guesses and suggest a guess from the remaining list.

There is also a version that takes a word as an imput and will make guesses until it finds it.

# How Does Wordle-Helper Work?

Wordle_helper.py compares the guess and corresponding tile colours inputted by the user to exclude words from the list of accepted Wordle words
